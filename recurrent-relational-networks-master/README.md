# Recurrent Relational Networks for Complex Relational Reasoning

Contains the code to reproduce the experiments in the paper Recurrent Relational Networks for Complex Relational Reasoning

### Sudoku

 * `python tasks/sudoku/train.py` will train a RRN with the hyper parameters from the paper and save the best model in the working directory
 * `python tasks/sudoku/test.py` will load the best model from the working directory and evaluate it on the test set


### BaBi

 * `python tasks/babi/train.py` will train a RRN with the hyper parameters from the paper and save the best model in the working directory
 * `python tasks/babi/test.py` will load the best model from the working directory and evaluate it on the test set
